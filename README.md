**Real-Time Face  Detection And Recognition System**

Hello Everyone this is Animesh Singha, Student of  Rangamati Science and Technology University pursuing my Bsc  engineering in Computer Science
This is one of my project's in Digital Image Processing  Python Developement field which i have created,basically with  Python Based on  Student’s  Attendance System that uses the property of Real-Time Face  Detection And Recognition .

For More Details or Any Suggestions you can Reach me at animeshsingha1497@gmail.com

Real-time face detection and recognition is like a smart computer that can quickly find and know people's faces in pictures or videos. First, it looks at the picture or video and tries to find where faces are. It does this by using special tools and techniques that help it see patterns that look like faces. Once it finds a face, it then tries to figure out who that person is. This part is like when you remember someone's face and know who they are.
The computer doesn't just remember faces like we do; it turns them into special codes that it can compare with other faces it knows. It's like having a secret language just for faces. This way, it can quickly tell if the face it's seeing matches someone it knows. These systems are used in lots of places, like security cameras, where they can quickly spot if someone is who they say they are.

* Language Used: Python
* Database Used: Google Firebase
*Development tools : Pycharm IDE ; Browser ; python – 3.7

HERE ARE SOME PREVIEWS OF MY APPLICATION

Student Features
Student will come and show their faces to the webcam. Then the Real-Time Face  Detection And Recognition System program will check the image by checking the given databases that given earlier and find the possible matching person by comparing the given image and database. While a student match with the database his details are shown as per the above image and show his some informations that inputed earlier to database.   

**Working Process**
Setting up Webcam
Inputting Images
Detect Face with given images
Face Preprocessing
Face Encoding
Database Setup
Add Data to  Database (Firebase)
Add  Images to  Database (Firebase)
Real Time Database
Output Visualization



Please Checkout my Project of  Real-Time Face  Detection And Recognition System to implement the code and execute the program properly.
